# MPS Pytorch

In this tutorial, we formalize some aplications of MPS to train images data.
* `MPSPytorch.ipynb`: It is devoted to apply MPS architecture to MNIST experiment. We have based our code on the MNIST example of MPS pytorch. However, we wrote all functionalities in the code, i.e., each of code line has an explanation about its role in the algorithm (except in the training).
