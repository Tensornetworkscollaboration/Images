The goal of this work is apply the tensor network formalism to Image Processing (e.g. Clasification, Semantic-Segmentation). 
This repository is composed of different projects inspired on physical systems described by MPS (Matrix Product States), 
PEPS (Particle Entanglement Pairs States), MERA (Matrix Entanglement Renormalization Algorithm). 
Also, we study several experiments with crossroads in Machine Learning (ML) and Image Processing (IP). 
This project is enogouraged by the Physics and Machine Learning Group of the National University of Colombia
