The goal of this work is apply the tensor network formalism to Image Processing. 
This repository is composed of different projects inspired on and by physical systems described by Matrix Product States (MPS), PEPS, MERA.
Also, we study several experiments with crossroads in Machine Learning (ML) and Image Processing (NLP). 
This project is developed by the Physics and Machine Learning Group of the National University of Colombia
