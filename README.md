The goal of this work is to apply the tensor network formalism to Image Processing (e.g., Classification, 
Semantic-Segmentation). This repository is composed of different projects inspired on physical systems described 
by MPS (Matrix Product States), PEPS (Projected Entangled Pairs States), 
MERA (Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz). Also, we study several experiments with crossroads in Machine Learning (ML) and Image Processing (IP). The Physics and Machine Learning Group of the National University of Colombia 
develops and encourages this proposal.
